# Simple-Banking-Application



Abstract:
This project paper presents a simple banking application implemented in Java. The application allows users to perform basic banking operations such as checking the account balance, making deposits, withdrawing funds, and viewing the previous transaction. The project utilizes object-oriented programming principles and input/output handling using the Scanner class.

Introduction:
The banking application aims to provide users with a convenient and user-friendly interface to manage their bank accounts. It allows users to perform essential banking operations without the need for complex banking software or visiting a physical bank branch. The application is implemented in Java, making it platform-independent and easily accessible to a wide range of users.

Features:
The banking application offers the following features:

a. Account Creation:
Users can create a new bank account by providing their name and ID.

b. Account Management:
Users can check their account balance, make deposits, and withdraw funds. The application keeps track of the previous transaction and provides an option to view it.

c. User Interaction:
The application presents a menu-based interface where users can select options using single-character inputs. The menu provides clear instructions and options for each operation.

Implementation Details:
The application is implemented using Java programming language. The main class, BankingApplication, serves as the entry point of the program. It prompts the user to enter their name and ID, which are then used to create a BankAccount object.

The BankAccount class represents an individual bank account and encapsulates its properties and operations. It maintains variables such as balance, previousTransaction, customerName, and customerId. The class provides methods to deposit funds, withdraw funds, retrieve the previous transaction, and display a menu for user interaction.

User Interface:
The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. Upon successful account creation, the user is welcomed and presented with a menu containing options such as checking the balance, making deposits, withdrawing funds, viewing the previous transaction, and exiting the application.

Conclusion:
The simple banking application provides a basic yet functional banking system that enables users to perform essential banking operations. It demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming concepts, user input handling, and menu-driven interfaces. The application can serve as a starting point for further enhancements and additions to create a more comprehensive banking system.

Future Enhancements:
Although the current implementation provides the core functionalities, several enhancements can be made to expand the application's capabilities, such as:

a. Adding multiple account support
b. Implementing authentication and security measures
c. Incorporating database integration for persistent storage
d. Enabling fund transfer between accounts
e. Implementing interest calculations and other financial features

These enhancements would make the application more robust and feature-rich, offering a more comprehensive banking experience.


In conclusion, the simple banking application project provides users with a convenient way to manage their bank accounts. Through the implementation of core banking operations and a user-friendly interface, the application serves as a practical demonstration of Java programming and object-oriented principles. The project can be extended and enhanced to create a more comprehensive and secure banking system to meet the evolving needs of users.
